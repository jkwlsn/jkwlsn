# I used to be a writer, now I'm learning to code

Junior Software Engineer with a background in digital media. In January, 2025, I enrolled at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), a selective, intensive London-based bootcamp designed for career-switchers. I chose the software engineering and DevOps tracks to complement my previous experience in front-end design.

On the 16-week, full-time, on-site course, I gained practical experience in group work, paired programming, agile project development, TDD, Python, AWS, and CI/CD workflows. On the DevOps specialism track, I got hands-on with DevOps tools including Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I'm now teaching myself TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js.

With an award-winning education in art history, and background in web development and digital comms & media, I understand the value of visual design and analytical thinking. As a magazine and copy writer, I know how to communicate complex systems in simple terms. That, combined with my curiosity, growth mindset, constant motivation (and varied work history) means I can talk to you about the controversy of the C in CSS, and the parallels between RESTful APIs and beehives, and why Deliveroo was inevitably doomed.

I'm open for work as of [May 2025](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20250519%2F20250520&details=%3Col%3E%3Cli%3ECheck%20out%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjkwlsn%22%3Elinkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjkwlsn%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3ECheck%20out%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjkwlsn%22%3Egithub.com%2Fjkwlsn%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EEmail%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailt%3Ahi%40jkwlsn.dev%22%3Ehi%40jkwlsn.dev%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3E%3Cstrong%3EHire%20him%3C%2Fstrong%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E&text=Jake%20Wilson%20has%20graduated%20from%20Makers%20Software%20Engineering%20and%20DevOps%20Bootcamp%21&location=London%2C%20UK&add=hi@jkwlsn.dev&trp=true&sprop=https%3A%2F%2Fjkwlsn.dev&sprop=name:Jake%20Wilson).

## Projects

### apis-api

I'm drawing on my time spent working as a beekeeper to build [`apis-api`](https://github.com/jkwlsn/apis-api), a RESTful HTTP API for managing beehives. It's an work-in-progress designed to teach me new skills and Python techniques, as well as build a working application. Once the Python / Postgres / FastAPI backend is complete, I'll build a Typescript / Vue.js frontend. Watch and star the repo, and follow my progress on the [project page](https://github.com/users/jkwlsn/projects/3).

### apis-app

I'll be following up with `apis-app`, a TypeScript and Vue.js frontend. I'll be focusing on offline capabilities.

## Older work

Years before I studied at Makers, I taught myself web development fundamentals and coded a few websites:
- I helped design students at the Royal College of Arts, London, build their final project website: [rca-poster-archive.co.uk [defunct]](https://github.com/rca-poster-archive/rca-poster-archive/)
  - Opted for static site generator, vanilla CSS and JS for simplicity of design and speed.
  - Built pipelines to generate responsive webp images.
  - Hosted static assets on AWS S3.
- I rebuilt the website of a London-based art gallery / hair salon: [dkuk.biz [defunct]](https://github.com/jkwlsn/dkuk-wp-theme)
  - Mobile-first design
  - Focused on performance
- I rebuilt the website of Australian photography magazine _Paper Journal_: [paper-journal.com [defunct]](https://github.com/Paper-Journal)
  - Rebuilt entire codebase: focused on mobile-first, high performance design, introduced responsive images, added static HTML cache, fixed broken infinite scroll.
  - Cut load times from 500ms to 80ms.
  - Achieved 97% on Lighthouse.
