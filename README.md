# I used to be a writer, now I'm learning to code

Junior Software Engineer with a background in digital media. In January, 2025, I enrolled at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), a selective, intensive London-based bootcamp designed for career-switchers. I chose the software engineering and DevOps tracks to complement my previous experience in front-end design.

On the 16-week, full-time, on-site course, I gained practical experience in group work, paired programming, agile project development, TDD, Python, AWS, and CI/CD workflows. On the DevOps specialism track, I got hands-on with DevOps tools including Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I'm now teaching myself TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js.

With a background in arts and culture writing, I have great experience discovering solutions to real world problems through interviews, communication, collaboration. I am creative, curious, highly adaptable and willing to put the work in to grow my knowledge and optimise my work.

I'm open for work as of [May 2025](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20250519%2F20250520&details=%3Col%3E%3Cli%3ECheck%20out%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjkwlsn%22%3Elinkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjkwlsn%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3ECheck%20out%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjkwlsn%22%3Egithub.com%2Fjkwlsn%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EEmail%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailt%3Ahi%40jkwlsn.dev%22%3Ehi%40jkwlsn.dev%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3E%3Cstrong%3EHire%20him%3C%2Fstrong%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E&text=Jake%20Wilson%20has%20graduated%20from%20Makers%20Software%20Engineering%20and%20DevOps%20Bootcamp%21&location=London%2C%20UK&add=hi@jkwlsn.dev&trp=true&sprop=https%3A%2F%2Fjkwlsn.dev&sprop=name:Jake%20Wilson).
